## Here it is necessary to have 8G or higher volume.

### create one single partiotion

[root@localhost ~]#fdisk /dev/sdb

#### Format using vfat, but before that it is necessary to make sure volumn is unmounted.

[root@localhost ~]#mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1

#####Issue the following command by giving correct path to the iso image.

[root@localhost ~]#dd if=/home/alwis/Downloads/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1908.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=8M
