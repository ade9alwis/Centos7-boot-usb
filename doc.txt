## Here it is necessary to have 8G or higher volume.	

### create one single partition	

[root@localhost ~]#fdisk /dev/sdb

#### Format using vfat, but before that, it is necessary to make sure the volume is unmounted.

[root@localhost ~]#mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1

#####Issue the following command by giving the correct path to the iso image.	

[root@localhost ~]#dd if=/home/alwis/Downloads/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1908.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=8M 

NB:-NB:- It is very important to set up the bootable volume as USB in BIOS.
